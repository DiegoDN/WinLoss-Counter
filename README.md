This is a simple tool to track Win ratio over Battle Lounges and Casual Matches. 

When you play Ranked Matches, you can follow up your progress, but when you play Casual Matches is difficult to really remember the results of all them.

This tool will help you with that. Just click on plus after Won/Lost a Fight and it will give you your Win Ratio %.
